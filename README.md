# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Dosbol Aliev**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Summary

**NASA API** is an Android app that displays the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) from NASA's API, including the image, title, description, and date.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üõ∞Ô∏èüååüì∑

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [X] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [X] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **date=YYYY-MM-DD**
- [X] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [X] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **[NASA_API](https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?count=100&api_key=DEMO_KEY)**.

## Video Demo

## ‚úÖ Notes

- I learned how to make API calls using **AsyncHTTPClient** and parse JSON responses in Kotlin.
- This project taught me how to use **RecyclerView** to display dynamic data and update it based on user input.
- I implemented a **query parameter (date)** in the API request, which helped me understand how to interact with real-world APIs.
- I used **Glide** to load images efficiently from URLs into an `ImageView`.
- I gained experience handling user input via **EditText** and updating the UI with **Button** clicks.
- One challenge was understanding the JSON structure and handling optional fields like `hdurl`, but it helped me improve my debugging skills.
- Overall, this unit made me more confident working with APIs and building user-responsive Android apps.
